	6.Consider an integer array, the number of elements in which is determined by the user. 
	The elements are also taken as input from the user. 
	Write a program to find those pair of elements that has the maximum and minimum difference among all element pairs.
	maximum difference = highest-lowest
	minimum difference = second lowest - lowest
